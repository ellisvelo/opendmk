WARNING: These files have been generated by 'rmic'

They are provided for interoperability with legacy Java DMK(TM) agent
and manager applications.

The rmic generated files have been postprocessed to change their
serial version UID in a way that guarantees compatibility with
older versions of the Java(TM) DMK toolkit.

This is seriously complicated.  We want project OpenDMK, Java DMK5.1 and 
Java DMK5.0 to be interoperable with each other. Since JDMK4.2 we use the
JDK1.2 RMI scheme when talking RMI to another JDMK agent or client.  
But we have historical constraints since JDMK4.1, which used
the JDK1.1 RMI scheme even when built on a JDK1.2 system (it invoked
rmic with the -v1.1 flag).  However, "rmic -vcompat" produces
stub files with the serialVersionUID hardwired to 2, which means that
they are not interoperable with "rmic -v1.1" files, which leave the
serialVersionUID at its default (hashcode-computed) value.  

So, we first ran "rmic -v1.1" in order to find out what this serialVersionUID
is, then edited the "rmic -vcompat" file to set the serialVersionUID there
to the same value.
This sequence was repeated for each stub.

Do not regenerate these files without applying the same process.
