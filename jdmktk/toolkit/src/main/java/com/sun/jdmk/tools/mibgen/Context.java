/**
 * This class is intended to carry contextual information about
 * a mib generation.
 * Things like:
 * <li>prefixes</li>
 * <li>the mib being generated</li>
 * <li>contextual translation tables</li>
 * <li>etc...</li>
 * should eventually be stored in this object.
 *
 * Ideally, all the contextual information necessary to the generation
 * of a particular MIB should be placed in there, rather than in the
 * set of generators instantiated for generating this mib.
 * In other words, the generators should contain the code (how to generate)
 * and the context should contain the data (the set of parameters that help
 * the generators decide what to generate).
 *
 * The context should eventually be passed as parameters to all the
 * generator's methods (rather than being stored in the generators).
 * This would allow to reuse the generators over several generations.
